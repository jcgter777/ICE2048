# ICE2048
The classic math puzzle game 2048 ported to ICE for the CE. 

I2048SRC is the source code, I2048SPR has the sprites, and ICE2048 is the compiled version. 

I2048SRC.txt and I2048SPR.txt are the things from on calc, and from TI-Connect CE. SC2048SRC.txt and SC2048SPR.txt are, fittingly, the code from SourceCoder.

# ICE2048
The classic math puzzle game 2048 ported to ICE for the CE. 

I2048SRC is the source code, I2048SPR has the sprites, and ICE2048 is the compiled version. ICE2048.8xg has the whole source. 

Normal_code.txt is the code on calc, and from TI-Connect CE. SC_version_of_code.txt is, fittingly, the code for/from SourceCoder.
